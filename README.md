# DIT_Tools
DIT Tools is an integrated digital imaging toolkit for commercials, TV, and film. It speeds up on-set wrap by providing directory sync with logging, file comparison, Render Check (inspired by John Spellmanâ€™s RenderCheck), and .drx file management. Built in Python 3 via py2app (beta, use at your own risk).
