# DIT_Tools
DIT Tools is an integrated digital imaging toolkit designed to streamline on-set workflows and accelerate the wrap process for commercial, TV, and film productions. It features:

• A robust Project Folder Creator that automates the creation of structured project directories—including customizable transcode and DIT folder options—to simplify project organization.
• Directory synchronization with cancellation and logging.
• File comparison across external drives with logging. (Because all Client drives should match.)
• Render Check functionality inspired by John Spellman’s acclaimed RenderCheck AppleScript. (Matches Camera Originals to Transcodes.)
• .drx file removal. (Handy after creating stills in DaVinici Resolve)

Built entirely in Python 3 with no external dependencies and compiled using py2app, this beta release is provided as-is (use at your own risk).
